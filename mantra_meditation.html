                            In this age of quarrel and anxiety (Kali-yuga), Krishna incarnates as His Holy Name. The
                            Vedic scripture
                            Kali-Santarana Upanisad mentions that the best mantra recommended for this age is the Hare
                            Krishna mantra : Hare
                            Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Mantra meditation involves repeating the mantra in mood of prayer or as a form of meditation
                            and focusing the mind
                            on the sound vibration of the mantra.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Srila Prabhupada on Chanting (the Hare Krishna Mantra)
                            The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra (Hare
                            Krishna Hare Krishna
                            Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare) is the sublime method of
                            reviving our Krishna
                            consciousness. As living spiritual souls we are all originally Krishna conscious entities,
                            but due to our
                            association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now polluted by the
                            material atmosphere. The
                            material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called maya, or illusion. Maya means
                            “that which is not.” And
                            what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material
                            nature, while actually we are
                            under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the
                            all-powerful master, this is
                            called illusion. In this polluted concept of life, we are all trying to exploit the
                            resources of material nature,
                            but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore,
                            although we are engaged in a
                            hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle
                            against material nature
                            can be stopped at once by revival of our Krishna consciousness.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Krishna consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind; this consciousness is the
                            original energy of the
                            living entity. When we hear the transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. And
                            this process is
                            recommended for this age by authorities. By practical experience also, one can perceive that
                            by chanting this
                            maha-mantra, or the Great Chanting for Deliverance, one can at once feel a transcendental
                            ecstasy coming through
                            from the spiritual stratum. And when one is factually on the plane of spiritual
                            understanding – surpassing the
                            stages of senses, mind, and intelligence – one is situated on the transcendental plane.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting, or even a dog can
                            take part in it. Of
                            course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takes a little more time to come
                            to the standard point,
                            but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly.
                            When the mantra is
                            chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has the greatest efficacy on the hearers,
                            and as such, this
                            chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate
                            effects can be achieved. As
                            far as possible, chanting from the lips of non-devotees should be avoided. Milk touched by
                            the lips of a serpent has
                            poisonous effects.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The word Hara is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord, and the words Krishna and
                            Rama are forms of
                            addressing the Lord Himself. Both Krishna and Rama mean “the supreme pleasure,” and Hara is
                            the supreme pleasure
                            energy of the Lord, changed to Hare in the vocative. The supreme pleasure energy of the Lord
                            helps us to reach the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The material energy, called maya, is also one of the multi-energies of the Lord. And we, the
                            living entities, are
                            also the energy – marginal energy – of the Lord. The living entities are described as
                            superior to material energy.
                            When the superior energy is in contact with the inferior energy, an incompatible situation
                            arises; but when the
                            superior marginal energy is in contact with the superior energy, called Hara, the living
                            entity is established in
                            his happy, normal condition.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            These three words, namely Hare, Krishna and Rama, are the transcendental seeds of the
                            maha-mantra. The chanting is a
                            spiritual call for the Lord and His internal energy, Hara, to give protection to the
                            conditioned soul. This chanting
                            is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother. Mother Hara helps the devotee
                            achieve the grace of the
                            supreme father, Hari or Krishna, and the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee who chants this
                            mantra sincerely.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            No other means of spiritual realization, therefore, is as effective in this age as chanting
                            the maha-mantra: Hare
                            Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.
